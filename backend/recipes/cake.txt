# Instructions
To make the cake:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the eggs until they become light and fluffy. Add the milk and mix well.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture, beating continuously until just combined.
5. Melt the butter and let it cool slightly. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract to the batter and mix until smooth.
6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean.
8. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

To assemble the cake:
1. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate or cake stand.
2. Dust the top of the first layer with confectioners' sugar, if desired.
3. Place the second layer on top of the first layer and dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired.
4. Garnish with fresh fruit or nuts, if desired.
