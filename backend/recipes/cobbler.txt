# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine sliced peaches, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Let mixture sit for about 15 minutes, until peaches start to release their juice and the mixture becomes syrupy.
2. In another bowl, whisk together flour, oats, brown sugar, and cold butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Pour peach mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with crumb mixture, spreading evenly to cover the entire surface.
4. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbly.
5. Remove from oven and let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired.
