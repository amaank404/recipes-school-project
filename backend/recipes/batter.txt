# Instructions
To make the batter, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk until well combined.
Slowly pour in the cold water, whisking continuously until the batter reaches a smooth consistency without lumps.
Adjust the seasoning if needed, but be cautious not to over-season.
For specific types of battered foods, adjust the amount of liquid accordingly:
    - For lighter coatings (e.g., fish sticks), use less water.
    - For thicker coatings (e.g., onion rings), use more water.
Heat about 2 inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C).
Dip the prepared food item into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated, then carefully place it into the hot oil.
Fry until golden brown and cooked through, adjusting the cooking time based on the food type.
Drain excess oil using paper towels.
