# Instructions
To make caviar, start by rinsing the salmon eggs under cold running water to remove any impurities. Next, mix together the kosher salt, granulated sugar, and water in a small bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Add the citric acid, if using, and stir to combine.

Transfer the salmon eggs to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl. Pour the salt mixture over the eggs and let them cure for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator. Every few hours, gently massage the eggs with your fingers to help distribute the curing liquid evenly.

After the curing period, rinse the eggs under cold running water to remove excess salt. Pat the eggs dry with paper towels and transfer them to a clean glass jar or container. Cover the jar with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

Just before serving, sprinkle the caviar with fresh dill or chives and serve on toast points or crackers with crème fraîche or sour cream, if desired.
