# Instructions
To make the patties:
1. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
2. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients until they are just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
3. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Flatten each ball slightly into a patty.
4. Place the patties onto the preheated grill and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
5. While the burgers are cooking, toast the buns on the grill or in a toaster.

To assemble the burgers:
1. Once the burgers are cooked, let them rest for a few minutes before assembling the burgers.
2. Spread a layer of mayonnaise or ketchup onto the bottom bun.
3. Add a slice of cheese (if using).
4. Add a few slices of lettuce and tomato.
5. Place the cooked patty onto the bun.
6. Add any additional toppings you like (such as pickles or bacon).
7. Top with the top bun.

# Tips and Variations
