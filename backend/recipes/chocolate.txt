# Instructions
To start, roast the cacao beans in a 350°F (180°C) oven for 10-15 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned. Let cool completely. Next, grind the cooled cacao beans into a fine paste using a food processor or high-powered blender. Sift the cocoa powder and granulated sugar into a separate bowl. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the sugar and cocoa mixture, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and stir in the ground cacao bean paste, oil, vanilla extract (if using), and salt until well combined. If desired, add in nuts, dried fruit, or other mix-ins and fold them into the chocolate mixture.
