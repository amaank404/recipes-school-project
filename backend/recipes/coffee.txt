# Instructions
1. Begin by measuring out one tablespoon of ground coffee beans for every six ounces of water. Adjust this ratio according to personal taste preferences for stronger or weaker brews.
2. Boil fresh water in a kettle or on the stovetop. Use filtered water if possible for better flavor.
3. Pour the boiling water over the measured coffee grounds in a filter or a French press. If using a drip coffee maker, place the filter in the machine and add the grounds.
4. Allow the coffee to steep for the desired amount of time. For a lighter brew, steep for 3-4 minutes; for a darker brew, steep for 5-6 minutes.
5. Once the brewing process is complete, remove the filter or press down the plunger of the French press to separate the grounds from the liquid.
6. Pour the freshly brewed coffee into a cup and serve immediately. Add sugar, milk, creamer, or flavorings as desired.
7. If serving over ice, fill a glass with ice first and then pour the coffee over the ice.
8. Enjoy your freshly brewed cup of coffee!
