# Instructions
To make this homemade cider, start by washing and peeling the apples. Cut them into small pieces and place them in a large pot. Add the gallon of water and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the apples have broken down and the liquid has reduced slightly.

Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard the solids and let the liquid cool to room temperature. If desired, add the brown sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and nutmeg to the liquid and stir to combine.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cider for at least 2 hours or overnight. Before serving, strain the cider again through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any sediment. For a fizzy cider, mix in some carbonated water. Taste and adjust the sweetness and spice level to your liking.

Note: This recipe makes a still cider. To make sparkling cider, you can use a SodaStream machine or purchase pre-made sparkling water.
