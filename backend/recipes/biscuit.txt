# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Pour in the buttermilk and stir the mixture with a fork until it forms a shaggy dough.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together. Don't overwork the dough!
5. Roll the dough out to about 1 inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out rounds. Gather scraps, re-roll the dough, and cut out more biscuits.
6. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between each biscuit.
7. Brush the tops of the biscuits with beaten egg and sprinkle with honey or sugar if desired.
8. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown.

# Tips and Variations
- For an extra-flaky biscuit, try folding the dough in half after step 3 and then rolling it out again before cutting out the biscuits.
- To make drop biscuits, skip the rolling and cutting process and simply drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet.
- Experiment with different flavors by adding herbs like chives or rosemary, or grated cheese to the dough.
