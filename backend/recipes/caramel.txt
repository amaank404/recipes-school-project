# Instructions
Combine the sugar, water, and sea salt in a medium saucepan and place it on medium heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the caramel turns a deep amber color.

Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour in the heavy cream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.

Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the caramel has thickened slightly and passed the "wrinkle test".

Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract (if using). Let the caramel cool slightly before transferring it to a clean glass jar or container.

To test if the caramel is ready, place a small amount on a plate and let it cool to room temperature. If it wrinkles when pushed with your finger, it's ready. If not, continue cooking and testing until it reaches the desired consistency.

# Tips and Variations
- To make a darker caramel, cook the mixture for an additional 5-10 minutes.
- To add a smoky flavor, cook the caramel over a low flame or with a blowtorch after removing it from the heat.
- Experiment with different flavorings such as fleur de sel, coffee beans, or citrus zest.
- For a lighter caramel, use less sugar or cook the mixture for a shorter amount of time.
- To make a more stable caramel, cook the mixture to 240°F (115°C) instead of the wrinkle test.
