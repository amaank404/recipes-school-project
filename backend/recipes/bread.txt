# Instructions
To begin, combine the warm water and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy and bubbly. Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Place the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, if desired. If using an egg wash, brush it gently over the top of the loaf. Sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds over the loaf, if desired. Bake the bread for 25-35 minutes, or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

# Tips and Variations
- To create a crispy crust, bake the bread at a higher temperature (425°F) for the first 10-12 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375°F for the remaining time.
- For a more rustic bread, skip kneading the dough and instead fold it several times during the rising process.
- Experiment with different flavor combinations by adding herbs, spices, nuts, or dried fruits to the dough before shaping.
- For a gluten-free bread, substitute the all-purpose flour with a gluten-free flour blend and adjust the liquid content accordingly.
