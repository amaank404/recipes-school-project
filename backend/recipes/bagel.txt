# Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let the mixture sit for 5-7 minutes until the yeast is activated and frothy.
2. Add the oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, one cup at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. You may not need all of the remaining flour, so add it gradually and be prepared to stop adding flour when the dough feels right.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.
6. Preheat a large pot of water and add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar to the water. Bring the water to a boil.
7. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and add the risen dough to the pot, a few pieces at a time. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until the bagels are golden brown.
8. Remove the cooked bagels from the water with a slotted spoon and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
9. Brush the tops of the bagels with the beaten egg for a glaze, and sprinkle with sesame seeds or poppy seeds if desired.
10. Bake the bagels in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
11. Remove the bagels from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.
