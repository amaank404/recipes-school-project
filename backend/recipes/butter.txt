# Instructions
To begin, pour the heavy cream into a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl if you're using a handheld electric mixer. If you don't have either, you can also use a whisk and do this manually.
Using the stand mixer or electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until it begins to thicken and form soft peaks. This is the first stage of churning the cream, which will eventually turn into butter.
Continue beating until you notice the cream starting to break down further. At this point, it might look a bit like whipped cream but still hold its shape somewhat when dropped by spoonfuls back into the bowl. This is where the magic happens - you're transitioning from cream to butter!
Keep beating until the mixture splits into two distinct parts: the butter solids (which will clump together and look like small pieces of dough) and the buttermilk (a liquid that separates from the solids). Stop the mixer once you see this separation occurring.
Transfer the butter mixture to a cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Squeeze out as much buttermilk as possible from the butter solids. Rinse the butter under cold running water to remove any remaining buttermilk. Finally, use your hands or a wooden spatula to knead the butter gently until it becomes smooth and pliable.
If desired, add a pinch of salt to the butter and mix well to distribute evenly. Your freshly made butter is now ready to be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
Note: Homemade butter has a higher moisture content than store-bought butter, so it may become too soft at room temperature. If needed, place the butter in the freezer for about 30 minutes before using.

# Tips and Variations
- For cultured butter, mix in a spoonful of active cultured yogurt or sour cream after rinsing the butter with cold water. This adds a tangy, creamy flavor.
- To make browned butter, melt the butter over low heat in a saucepan, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a golden brown color and smells nutty.
- Experiment with different flavorings by adding herbs (like parsley, dill, or chives), spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, or cayenne pepper), or grated citrus zest to your butter during the kneading step.
