# Instructions
To start, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.

In a large skillet, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.

Add the cooked spaghetti to the bowl with the egg mixture and toss to combine, ensuring the spaghetti is well coated.

Add the reserved pasta water to the bowl in small increments and continue to toss until the spaghetti is coated in a creamy sauce.

Return the skillet with the bacon to medium heat and add the spaghetti and egg mixture to the pan. Toss everything together until the spaghetti is well coated in the bacon fat and the sauce has thickened.

Season with salt and black pepper to taste, then serve immediately, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
