# Instructions
- In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup of cold water and let it sit for about 5 minutes to soften.
- Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup of water in a medium saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
- Bring the mixture to a boil, then attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Cook to 300°F (hard-ball stage).
- Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully add the softened gelatin to the mixture. Stir until the gelatin is fully incorporated.
- Let the mixture cool slightly, until it reaches 275°F (soft-ball stage). This should take about 5-7 minutes.
- Add food coloring and flavor extracts, if using, and stir well.
- Pour the mixture onto a greased surface, such as a silicone mat or a piece of parchment paper. Allow it to cool and set at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes.
- Once set, break the candy into small pieces and dust with confectioners' sugar.
