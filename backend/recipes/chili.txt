# Instructions
To start, brown the ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Once browned, remove the excess fat from the pot and set aside. In the same pot, add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.

Next, add the diced bell peppers and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper (if using), and cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the spices to bloom.

Add the browned ground beef back into the pot, followed by the diced tomatoes, red kidney beans, and pinto beans. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then stir everything together to combine.

Bring the chili to a simmer and let cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have melded together and the sauce has thickened slightly.

Serve hot, garnished with optional toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream, diced onions, or sliced jalapeños.

# Tips and Variations
