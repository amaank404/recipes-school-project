# Instructions
To make the filling:
1. In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
4. If using chicken, add it to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through.
5. Stir in the cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

To assemble the chimichangas:
1. Preheat the oil in a deep frying pan to 350°F (180°C).
2. Dip each tortilla in hot water for a few seconds to make them pliable.
3. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the filling onto the center of a tortilla.
4. Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll the tortilla into a tight cylinder.
5. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.
6. Fry the chimichangas for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.

To serve:
1. Serve the chimichangas hot with your choice of toppings.
2. Offer salsa, sour cream, and avocado on the side for dipping.
